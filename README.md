# Sparklinex

## Descripton

This is a package for generating sparkline graphs in PNG format. This package is inspired (and heaviliy 
based on) Geoffrey Grosenbach's `sparklines` gem for Ruby.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `sparklinex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sparklinex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

If you wish to see examples of all the different graphs available, you can run `mix example_test`. 
This will generate an HTML file at `test/actual/index.html`, which will have generate a set of graphs 
and display them side by side with known exemplars.

## Status

This project is currently just getting started.

#### Done

#### Todo

- Bar graphs
- Pie graphs
- Whisker graphs 
- Area graphs
- Bullet graphs
- Discrete graphs
- HexDocs
- TypeDocs
